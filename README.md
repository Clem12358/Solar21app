# Solar21 Site Evaluation Tool

A simple tool to help Solar21 partners quickly assess whether a site could be a good candidate for solar energy projects.

---

## What is this tool for?

This application is designed to support **Solar21's partnership network**. It helps partners evaluate whether their clients' buildings could be valuable leads to refer to Solar21 for rooftop solar installations.

By answering a few straightforward questions about a site, partners receive a **score from 0 to 100** indicating how well the site matches Solar21's criteria for successful solar projects.

---

## Who should use this tool?

- **Partners of Solar21** — Use this tool to quickly screen potential sites before referring them. A higher score means the site is more likely to be a good fit.
- **Solar21 employees** — Can access additional settings to adjust how scores are calculated and manage the evaluation questions.

## How does it work?

### Step 1: Choose your language
Select English, French, or German.

### Step 2: Select your role
- **Partner**: Go directly to site evaluation
- **Employee**: Access configuration settings (password required)

### Step 3: Enter site addresses
Add one or more addresses you want to evaluate. For each site, you'll need to provide:
- The full address
- The canton (Swiss region)
- Rooftop information (area, pitch, orientation) — you can find these values on [sonnendach.ch](https://www.sonnendach.ch)

### Step 4: Answer evaluation questions
For each site, answer questions about:
- **Who owns the building** (public entity, commercial company, private individual)
- **Sustainability engagement** (does the owner have visible ESG commitments?)
- **Electricity consumption patterns** (annual spend, daytime usage, seasonal variation)
- **Equipment** (are there 24/7 loads like cold storage or servers?)

### Step 5: View results
Each site receives a score based on two main factors:
- **Structure Score** — Based on roof size, ownership type, and sustainability profile
- **Consumption Score** — Based on electricity spend and usage patterns

The final score combines these factors and provides:
- A **numerical score** (0-100)
- An **interpretation** (Exceptional match, Strong match, Moderate suitability, etc.)
- A **recommendation** for next steps

## Understanding the scores

| Score Range | Interpretation | What it means |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 85-100 | Exceptional match | High priority opportunity |
| 70-84 | Strong match | Promising candidate for next steps |
| 50-69 | Moderate suitability | Needs deeper analysis |
| 30-49 | Weak alignment | Only consider if roof is large or location is strategic |
| 0-29 | Poor fit | Likely not viable for Solar21's model |
